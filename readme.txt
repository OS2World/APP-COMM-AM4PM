I give up. I simply have no time anymore for AM4PM. Since I think there is a need
for such a program I hope someone can pick up the thread and continue the development.

The program sources and makefile are for IBM CSet. It is plain old C code. Perhaps not very
well commented or perfectly structured, but it compiles cleanly and works. See AM4PM.DOC (in
MS Word 6 format) for a discription of AM4PM.

Make something nice of it!
